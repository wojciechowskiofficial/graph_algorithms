basic program functionalities:

	*generating undirected graphs into .txt file
	*generating DAGgers (directed acyclic graphs) into .txt file
	*representing graphs by:
		@adjecency matrix
		@incidence matrix
		@edge list
		@incidence list
	*performing topological sort on given DAGger

program also measures times of performing "search edge" method and "perform topological sort method".
